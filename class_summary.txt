print(help(class)) - This will print out a help message for the class, including all its attributes and methods.

super().__init__ - This is used to call the parent class's __init__ method from the child class's __ init__ method.

Employee.__init__ - This is used to call the parent class's __init__ method from the child class's __ init__ method but from specific class. (in this case Employee)

isinstance() - This is used to check if an object is an instance of a class.

issubclass() - This is used to check if a class is a subclass of another class.
